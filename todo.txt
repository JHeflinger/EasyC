- create tests for condition variables
- lazy arena allocator:
    - arena allocator but you can "free" blocks
    - whenever you attempt to allocate, you check two locations:
      1. check backwards moving pointer if it is pointing to a chunk big enough
      2. if big enough, allocate to that chunk, and move backwards moving pointer forwards.
      3. if not big enough, move backwards moving pointer back one block and allocate at the end of the arena instead
    - dont forget that when you "free" a block merge it with the blocks around it if they are free as well
